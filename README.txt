"History AI Museum Game"

The scene is designed to help people memorize the dates of key historical milestones that AI has reached.

There are five rooms, each containing an image or model of a milestone breakthrough or technology. Users can stop and think to themselves about the date when the event occurred. They can then press the red button, which will reveal a picture of the person involved, along with their name and the date that the event happened.

"dcl init" has already been run. To run the scene with Node.js, use "dcl start".
