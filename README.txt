The scene is designed to help people memorise the dates of the key historical milestones that AI has reached.

There are five rooms each room contains an image or model of a milestone breakthrough or technology. The user can then stop and think to themselves what the date that it occurred may have been. The user can then press the red button which will reveal a picture of the person involved along with their name and the date that the event happened.
